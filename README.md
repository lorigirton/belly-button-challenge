This challenge required building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset that displays the diverse microbial species found in navels. This study found over 2300 species however only a handful were present across 70% ot the samples (referred to as OTUs or operational taxonomic units). 

A url of json data was provided and I utilized d3 to read in the data. Then I initialized the page with a default plot as well as dropdown menu. I then created a function to build the charts and used d3 to fetch the sample data for the plots. The next step was to build a bubble chart and bar chart using the sample data. I then created a function for building the metadata and another function to change the visuals when the dropdown menu changed.
